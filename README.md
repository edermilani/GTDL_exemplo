In this code we present the main functions developed for the article "Incorporation of frailties into a non-proportional hazard regression model and its diagnostics for reliability modeling of downhole safety valves"

The code is divided into 4 parts, with
Part 1) Reading the data. A data set was generated by the GTDL model. It is presented in the file example_gtdl.csv
Part 2) Verification of assumption of proportional hazard
Part 3) Maximum likelihood estimation
Part 4) Diagnostic analysis. Through the analysis of randomized quantile residuals and global influence.
